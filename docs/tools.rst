Cocaine Tools Command Line Interface
====================================
This part describes cocaine command line tools.
It is useful for management your cocaine cloud, uploading applications, profiles and other stuff.


Common tools
------------------------------------
This part describes common tools.


cocaine-tool info
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Show information about cocaine runtime

    Return json-like string with information about cocaine-runtime.

    >>> cocaine-tool info
    {
        "uptime": 738,
        "identity": "dhcp-666-66-wifi.yandex.net"
    }

    If some applications is running, its information will be displayed too.

    >>> cocaine-tool info
    {
        "uptime": 738,
        "apps": {
            "Echo": {
                "load-median": 0,
                "profile": "EchoProfile",
                "sessions": {
                    "pending": 0
                },
                "queue": {
                    "depth": 0,
                    "capacity": 100
                },
                "state": "running",
                "slaves": {
                    "active": 0,
                    "idle": 0,
                    "capacity": 4
                }
            }
        },
        "identity": "dhcp-666-66-wifi.yandex.net"
    }


cocaine-tool call
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Invoke specified method from service.

    Performs method invocation from specified service. Service name should be correct string and must be correctly
    located through locator. By default, locator endpoint is ```localhost, 10053```, but it can be changed by passing
    global `--host` and `--port` arguments.

    Method arguments should be passed in double quotes as they would be written in Python.
    If no method provided, service API will be printed.

    *Request service API*:

    >>> cocaine-tool call node
    API of service "node": [
        "start_app",
        "pause_app",
        "info"
    ]

    *Invoke `info` method from service `node`*:

    >>> cocaine-tool call node info
    {'uptime': 1855, 'identity': 'dhcp-666-66-wifi.yandex.net'}

    *Specifying locator endpoint*

    >>> cocaine-tool call node info --host localhost --port 10052
    LocatorResolveError: Unable to resolve API for service node at localhost:10052, because [Errno 61] Connection
    refused

    *Passing complex method arguments*

    >>> cocaine-tool call storage read "'apps', 'Echo'"
    [Lot of binary data]


Application specific tools
------------------------------------
This part describes application specific tools.

cocaine-tool app list
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Show installed applications list.

    Returns list of installed applications.

    >>> cocaine-tools app list
    [
        "app1",
        "app2"
    ]

cocaine-tool app view
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Show manifest context for application.

    If application is not uploaded, an error will be displayed.

    :name: application name.

    >>> cocaine-tool app view --name Echo
    {
        "slave": "/home/satan/echo/echo.py"
    }

cocaine-tool app upload
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Upload application with its environment (directory) into the storage.

    Application directory or its subdirectories must contain valid manifest file named `manifest.json` or `manifest`
    otherwise you must specify it explicitly by setting `--manifest` option.

    You can specify application name. By default, leaf directory name is treated as application name.

    If you have already prepared application archive (\*.tar.gz), you can explicitly specify path to it by setting
    `--package` option. Note, that PATH and --package options are mutual exclusive as well as --package and --venv
    options.

    If you specify option `--venv`, then virtual environment will be created for application.

    Possible values:
        * N - do not create virtual environment (default)
        * P - python virtual environment using virtualenv package
        * R - ruby virtual environment using Bundler (not yet implemented)
        * J - jar archive will be created (not yet implemented)

    Algorithm of creating and configuring **python virtual environment** contains following steps:
        * locating `virtualenv` module. It must be installed.
        * creating clear virtual environment via `virtualenv` module.
        * locating `manifest.json` or `manifest` file somewhere in the target directory or its subdirectories.
        * creating `bootstrap.sh` scrips for correct starting application via virtual environment.
        * cloning and installing cocaine-framework-python through git.
        * locating `requirements.txt` or `requirements` file somewhere in the target directory or its subdirectories.
        * installing all requirements specified in the file above (if it has been found)

    You can control process of creating and uploading application by specifying `--debug=tools` option. This is helpful
    when some errors occurred.

    .. warning:: Creating virtual environment may take a long time and can cause timeout. You can increase timeout by
                 specifying `--timeout` option.

    .. warning:: This is experimental feature.

    :path: path to the application root.
    :name: application name. If it is not specified, application will be named as its directory name.
    :manifest: path to application manifest json file.
    :package: path to application archive.
    :venv: virtual environment type. This is optional parameter and does nothing if not specified. Otherwise virtual
           environment will be created and configured.

    *The simplest usage*

    >>> cd /home/user/your_app
    >>> cocaine-tool app upload
    Application your_app has been successfully uploaded

    *But you can specify path directly as first positional argument like this*

    >>> cocaine-tool app upload ~/echo
    Application echo has been successfully uploaded

    *Explicitly set application name*

    >>> cocaine-tool app upload ~/echo --name TheEchoApp
    Application TheEchoApp has been successfully uploaded

    *If you want to explicitly specify application archive*

    >>> cocaine-tool app upload --name echo --manifest ~/echo/manifest.json --package ~/echo/echo.tar.gz
    Application echo has been successfully uploaded

    *Let's create python virtual environment and see detail log*

    >>> cocaine-tool app upload ~/echo --venv P --timeout 60 --debug tools
    You specified building virtual environment
    It may take a long time and can cause timeout. Increase it by specifying `--timeout` option if needed

        "Echo": "the app is not running"
    }

cocaine-tool app restart
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

        },
        {
            "Echo": "the app has been started"
        }
    ]

    *If application was not run and no profile name provided*

    >>> cocaine-tool app restart --name Echo
    Error occurred: Application "Echo" is not running and profile not specified

    *But if we specify profile name*

    >>> cocaine-tool app restart --name Echo --profile EchoProfile
    [
        {
            "Echo": "the app is not running"
        },
        {
            "Echo": "the app has been started"
        }
    ]

    *In case wrong profile just stops application*

    >>> cocaine-tool app restart --name Echo --profile EchoProf
    [
        {
            "Echo": "the app has been stopped"
        },
        {

    {
        "app": 2
    }

cocaine-tool group create
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Create new routing group and (optionally) specify its content.

    Specified content can be both direct json expression in single quotes, or path to the json file with settings.
    The settings itself must be key-value list, where `key` represents application name, and `value` represents its
    weight. For example:

    >>> cocaine-tool group create new_group '{
        "app": 1,
        "another_app": 2
    }'

    Let's create it from file:

    >>> cocaine-tool group create new_group ../group.json

    :name: routing group name.
    :content: routing group content. It can be both path to the json file, or typed direct expression in single quotes.

    .. warning:: All application weights must be positive integers.

cocaine-tool group remove

    :name: routing group name.

    >>> cocaine-tool group remove new_group

cocaine-tool group refresh
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Refresh routing group or groups, forcing locator to reread them from storage.

    :name: routing group name.

    .. note:: If group name is empty this command will refresh all groups.

    Let's refresh all groups:

    >>> cocaine-tool group refresh

    Or maybe only one:

    >>> cocaine-tool group refresh new_group

cocaine-tool group push
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Add application with its weight into the routing group.

    :name: routing group name.
    :app: application name.
    :weight: positive integer meaning application weight.

    .. warning:: application weight must be positive integer.

    Let's push application `echo` to the routing group `new_group` with weight `42`:

    >>> cocaine-tool group push new_group echo 42

cocaine-tool group pop
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Remove application from routing group.

    :name: routing group name.
    :app: application name.

    Here we are removing `echo` application from routing group `new_group`:

    >>> cocaine-tool group pop new_group echo
